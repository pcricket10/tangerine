class Tangerine:
    """
    The Tangerine class is a lightweight server configuration tool. It allows the setup and maintenance of a server 
    on a given host and port. It has capabilities for handling HTTP requests and responses, route management, 
    middleware processing, and socket creation.

    Attributes:
        host (str): The IP address or hostname where the server will be hosted.
        port (int): The port number where the server will be listening.
        routes (dict): A dictionary to manage routes. The keys are route URLs and the values are dictionaries with 
        HTTP methods (as keys) and their associated handler functions (as values).
        middlewares (list): A list of middleware functions to be executed before the route handlers.
        static_route_pattern: Placeholder for static route patterns.
        static_route_pattern_re: Placeholder for compiled regex patterns of static routes.
